# THE BEAST â€“ CSS

You have learned some valuable CSS properties along the way. You'll be using all of your knowledge to style the raw HTML in `index.html` to look like the screenshot below.

### Your will probably include of the following properties:

* `background-image`
* `background-color`
* `padding` (hint! this may look like: `padding-top`, `padding-left`, `padding-right`)
* `margin`
* `width`
* `border`
* `display` (hint! probably used with `inline-block`)
* `vertical-align`
* `color`
* `font`
* `font-weight`
* `font-style`
* `border`
* AND ANY MORE THAT YOU FIND HELPFUL! (remember google is your friend)

If any of these seem unfamiliar or you forget what you do, don't hesitate to google! Developers look up things like this all the time. 
Albert Einstein says:

Of course after using these over and over again, you'll begin to know them without looking it up!
